# 🌿 Third Chair Portfolio Demo  
**An end-to-end system to detect IP infringement, gather evidence, and automate respectful outreach — grounded in clarity, care, and lawful precision.**

---

## 🧭 Purpose  
This is not just a demo.  
It is a **reflection** of Third Chair’s own mission — to bring automation, scale, and strategy to in-house legal operations — without losing sight of truth, nuance, or human presence.

## 🔍 What This System Does  

1. **IP Infringement Detection**
   - Accepts a user-submitted text (poem, paragraph, product copy, etc.)
   - Crawls the web to detect possible content matches

2. **Evidence Gathering**
   - Screenshots of the matched page
   - OTS-stamped tamper-proof evidence
   - Snippet of the matched content for review

3. **Automated Outreach**
   - Emails are sent in staged sequences:
     - Initial gentle nudge
     - Follow-ups
     - Final legal letter
   - Email templates are customizable and human

4. **LLM-Aware Reply System**
   - If a recipient replies, the system:
     - Logs the reply
     - Drafts a respectful follow-up using an LLM
     - Awaits human approval before sending

5. **Court Escalation Flow**
   - If a case remains unresolved, it moves toward legal escalation
   - Human-readable logs + all evidence are bundled and shared with the client

## 🪶 Crafted With Presence

- No spam.
- No pressure.
- Just **clear signals** and **truthful steps**, delivered with care.

This system is not aggressive.  
It is **disciplined**, **attentive**, and **structured**,  
yet open to human review at every sensitive point.

## 🧪 Demo Mode (No Real Outreach Sent)

To allow safe exploration:

- Every job can include a **test email address**  
- All outreach and replies go **only** to this test inbox  
- Ideal for live demos and evaluation without disturbing real site owners

---

## 📚 Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** – Lightweight backend for job submission and review
- **PostgreSQL** – Event-driven, clear relational schema
- **Async Workers** – Background outreach + escalation flows
- **Zoho SMTP** – For real-world mail sending
- **OpenRouter (LLM)** – Reply drafting that reflects tone + context
- **OTS** – Tamper-proof timestamping of web matches

## 🧘 Why This Matters  

Legal tech often becomes noise:  
Too many tools, too many dashboards, too little clarity.

This project is an offering —  
to show that **automation can serve presence**,  
and **scale can still honor care**.

## ✉️ One Last Thing

This was not built to impress.

It was built because I see the soul of what Third Chair is doing.  
And I wanted to meet that soul — not with promises, but with presence.

If this resonates, I ready to build alongside you.
