        ## üåø Third Chair Portfolio Demo

        **An end-to-end system to detect IP infringement, gather evidence, and automate respectful outreach ‚Äî grounded in clarity, care, and lawful precision.**

        ---

        ### üß≠ Purpose

        This is not just a demo.
        It is a **reflection** of Third Chair‚Äôs own mission ‚Äî to bring automation, scale, and strategy to in-house legal operations ‚Äî without losing sight of truth, nuance, or human presence.

        ---

        ### üîç What This System Does

        1. **IP Infringement Detection**

        * Accepts a user-submitted text (poem, paragraph, product copy, etc.)
        * Crawls the web to detect possible content matches

        2. **Evidence Gathering**

        * Screenshots of the matched page
        * OTS-stamped tamper-proof evidence
        * Snippet of the matched content for review

        3. **Automated Outreach**

        * Emails are sent in staged sequences:

            * Initial gentle nudge
            * Follow-ups
            * Final legal letter
        * Email templates are customizable and human

        4. **LLM-Aware Reply System**

        * If a recipient replies, the system:

            * Logs the reply
            * Drafts a respectful follow-up using an LLM
            * Awaits human approval before sending

        5. **Court Escalation Flow**

        * If a case remains unresolved, it moves toward legal escalation
        * Human-readable logs + all evidence are bundled and shared with the client

        ---

        ### ü™∂ Crafted With Presence

        * No spam.
        * No pressure.
        * Just **clear signals** and **truthful steps**, delivered with care.

        This system is not aggressive.
        It is **disciplined**, **attentive**, and **structured**,
        yet open to human review at every sensitive point.

        ---

        ### üß™ Demo Mode (No Real Outreach Sent)

        To allow safe exploration:

        * Every job can include a **test email address**
        * All outreach and replies go **only** to this test inbox
        * Ideal for live demos and evaluation without disturbing real site owners

        ---

        ### üìö Tech Stack

        * **FastAPI** ‚Äì Lightweight backend for job submission and review
        * **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Event-driven, clear relational schema
        * **Async Workers** ‚Äì Background outreach + escalation flows
        * **Zoho SMTP** ‚Äì For real-world mail sending
        * **OpenRouter (LLM)** ‚Äì Reply drafting that reflects tone + context
        * **OTS** ‚Äì Tamper-proof timestamping of web matches

        ---

        ### üßò Why This Matters

        Legal tech often becomes noise:
        Too many tools, too many dashboards, too little clarity.

        This project is an offering ‚Äî
        to show that **automation can serve presence**,
        and **scale can still honor care**.

        ### ‚úâÔ∏è One Last Thing

        This was not built to impress.

        It was built because I see the soul of what Third Chair is doing.
        And I wanted to meet that soul ‚Äî not with promises, but with presence.

        If this resonates, I'm ready to build alongside you.
